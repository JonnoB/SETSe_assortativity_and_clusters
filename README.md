# Introduction_to_SETS

This repo contains the code for the methods paper introducing the SETS embeddings algortihm (aka SETSe algortihm).
Goal of this introduction is to explain the basic theory and practical operation of SETSe for projecting transport networks into 
the Strain, Elevation and Tension dimensions.

The main code script used in the paper is "introduction_to_setse2.Rmd". The GEM embeddings are done using the python script "peels_embedding.py". The post processing of the data produced by the python script is done in "comparison_embeddings.Rmd"
