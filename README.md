# Introducing the SETSe algorithm

This repo contains the code used in the paper "The spring bounces back" available from arxiv.org/abs/2007.09437 .
The paper introduces the Strain Elevation Tension Spring embedding (SETSe) algorithm.
THe goal of this introduction is to show the challanges faced by current approaches to analysing and representing networks
and demonstrate how SETSe's approach can improve the way we understand complex networks and the nodes they contain.

The main code script used in the paper is "introduction_to_setse2.Rmd". The GEM embeddings are done using the python script "peels_embedding.py". The post processing of the data produced by the python script is done in "comparison_embeddings.Rmd"
